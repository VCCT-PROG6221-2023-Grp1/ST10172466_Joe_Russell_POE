# PROG6221 POE Part 3

I was given the following feedback:
"Code looks great but avoid long methodsâ€¦they are error prone and hard to debug. Code logical and well structured."

I took steps to improve my program based on this feedback, I shortened some of the longer methods, I maintained my structured approach and I made sure that the application ran smoothly and looks visually appealing. I did not have enough feedback to implement any more changes based on it.

Welcome to the Recipe Application! This application is designed and implemented using C# and Visual Studio. 

To get started, follow these steps:

Select either "Add Recipe", "Search" or "Exit" for the following actions.

Select "Add Recipe" to add a new recipe, follow the prompts on screen and enter the recipe name. Then, enter as many ingredients as you want your recipe to have and for each ingredient, enter its name, quantity, and unit of measurement, calorie amount and the food group that it belongs to. Then, enter as many steps as you want your recipe to have and for each step, enter a description of the step.

Select "Search" to search for an existing recipe, there are 4 search options to choose from. The first is to enter the name of the recipe you want to search. The second is to enter the name of an ingredient that is contained within a recipe. The third is to select a food group that an ingredient belongs to, this displays all recipes that fit this description. The fourth is to enter the max calories that an ingredient in a recipe can contain.

All recipes that match the filters will be displayed and any recipe can be selected and any of the following actions can be done.

Select "Scale" to scale the recipe by a factor of 0.5 (half), 2 (double) or 3 (triple). The ingredient quantities will be adjusted accordingly.

Select "Reset Scale" to reset the quantities to the original values.

Select "Delete" to delete the current recipe.

Select "Display" to display the full recipe, including the ingredients and steps, in a neat format.

Select "Main Menu" to return to the original menu.

Select "Exit" on the main menu to exit the application.

Please note that the application does not persist user data between runs and data is only stored in memory while the software is running.

Thank you for using the Recipe Application.
