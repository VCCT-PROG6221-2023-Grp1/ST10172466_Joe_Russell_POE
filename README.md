# PROG6221 POE Part 1

Welcome to the Recipe Application! This application is designed and implemented using C# and Visual Studio. 

To get started, follow these steps:

Enter the number of ingredients and for each ingredient, enter its name, quantity, and unit of measurement. Then, enter the number of steps and for each step, enter a description of the step.

You can display the full recipe, including the ingredients and steps, in a neat format.

You can scale the recipe by a factor of 0.5 (half), 2 (double) or 3 (triple). The ingredient quantities will be adjusted accordingly.

You can reset the quantities to the original values.

You can clear all data to enter a new recipe.

Please note that the application does not persist user data between runs and data is only stored in memory while the software is running.

Thank you for using the Recipe Application.
