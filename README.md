# PROG6221 POE Part 2

I was given the following feedback:
"Looks and runs great, kind of… input validation and colour of errors I like. 
SA lot of commented code and I can see you tried complicating your life…
All in all good effort."

I took steps to improve my program based on this feedback, I continued to add input validation and colour coding, I implemented much of the previously commented code, I made sure that the application ran smoothly and looks visually appealing. I did not have enough feedback to implement any more changes based on it.

Enter 1 to add a new recipe, follow the prompts on screen and enter the recipe name.
